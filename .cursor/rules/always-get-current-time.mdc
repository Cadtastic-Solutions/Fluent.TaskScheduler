# Always get the current time and date instructions

Anytime you are updating documentation and there is a requirement to log the current date or last update of the document that you are generating, always look at the current systems date and time.
Dates are to populated using the local date-time settings to the machine or environment you are operating with-in.

If you are unsure about what date should be populated or what date time format to use, never assume, always as the end user.

Date Format: "MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss"
