Always use SOLID principles when creating or modifying code.
All Code files should have a single responsibility.
Always design to an interface.
Models should be simepl classes with properties similar to Data Transfer Objects
Try to create extensions as generics based on interfaces

Always design code to be as reusable as possible, remember to keep it (DRY)
